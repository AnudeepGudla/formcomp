AEM Component Structure: 

The AEM component will include a dialog for authors to configure the form, a client library for JavaScript and CSS, and the HTL script to render the form.

HTL Code: The HTL script will render the form dynamically based on the fetched questions.

Client Library: The client library will include the default.js script we created earlier.

Dialog: A dialog will allow authors to configure the form (e.g., endpoint URLs).

1. formcomp.html (HTL Script)
This HTL script will render the form dynamically. It uses the data-sly-use directive to fetch questions from the REST endpoint and render the form.

2. FormCompModel.java (Sling Model)
This Sling Model fetches the questions from the REST endpoint and makes them available to the HTL script.


3. dialog.xml (Component Dialog)
This dialog allows authors to configure the REST endpoint for fetching questions.

4. clientlibs (Client Library)
The client library includes the default.js script and any necessary CSS.

5. _cq_editConfig.xml (Edit Configuration)
This file enables the component to be editable in AEM.

6. styles.css (Optional)
Add any necessary CSS for styling the form.

Summary
HTL Script: Renders the form dynamically using data fetched from the REST endpoint.

Sling Model: Fetches questions from the REST endpoint and provides them to the HTL script.

Dialog: Allows authors to configure the REST endpoint.

Client Library: Includes the JavaScript and CSS for the form.

Edit Configuration: Makes the component editable in AEM.


Default JS Explanation

Steps

Step 1: Fetch Questions
We will use the Fetch API to retrieve the questions from the provided endpoint.

Step 2: Render the Form
We will dynamically generate the form based on the fetched questions. The form will include proper ARIA labels and validation messages.

Step 3: Submit Results
We will handle form submission by sending the data to the specified endpoint using a POST request.

Explanation:
Fetching Questions: The script fetches the questions from the REST endpoint using the Fetch API.

Rendering the Form: The form is dynamically generated based on the fetched questions. Each input field is created with appropriate attributes and event listeners for validation.

Validation: The validateInput function uses the Constraint Validation API to validate inputs and display error messages with proper ARIA attributes.

Form Submission: The handleFormSubmit function validates the form, prepares the submission data, and sends it to the specified endpoint using a POST request.

Accessibility Notes:
The form uses proper ARIA attributes (aria-invalid, aria-describedby) to ensure screen readers can announce validation errors.

Labels are associated with their respective inputs using the for attribute.

Error messages are dynamically inserted into the DOM and linked to the corresponding inputs.

This implementation ensures that the form is accessible, validates user input, and submits data correctly.
